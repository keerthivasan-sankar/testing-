cryptoflex.policy
====================

The PolicyEngine is the actual novel piece of this project.  Everything
else (sources, combiner, profiles) is orchestration around existing,
trusted cryptography.  This module is the "brain" that decides WHICH
profile an application should use, based entirely on LOCAL signals:

  - What's actually available on this machine (is liboqs built?)
  - The caller's stated constraint (prioritize speed vs. max security)
  - A locally bundled, versioned risk table (algorithm_status.json,
    shipped with the package - NOT fetched over the network)

Explicitly out of scope (by design, to stay local-first / no external
dependency):
  - Live network calls to check NIST/CNSA advisories
  - Any telemetry, phone-home, or remote policy fetch

If you need live threat-feed awareness, update the bundled JSON table
and release a new package version - that keeps a hard boundary against
this becoming a network-dependent trust-a-third-party system.
